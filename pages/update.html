    <h1>Updates</h1>

    <div class="version-container" style="background-image: linear-gradient(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4), rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4)), url('/img/websiteutility/update/3.0.png');">
      <h2>3.1: the third point one</h2>
      <p>Githack and other caching proxys have been blocked by linewize, goguardian, etc. Meaning that 90% of Luma's games and 7% of Luma's images have been blocked. Due to this constant downtime I am deprecating Githack and relying fully on Cloudflare Pages for game hosting. This means for you that all saves except for roms and flash games are gone, hopefully with Cloudflare this issue doesn't happen as often.</p>
      <p>Due to the deprecation of Githack, I lose the advantage of having file sizes above 25MB. As a result, many games may be temporarily or permanently broken. Here are the ones that I am aware of: Biters.io, Scrap Metal 3, Traffic Jam 3D, Quake 1 (maybe), Burrito Bison, Drift Hunters, Majora's Mask, Ocarina of Time, Tanuki Sunset, The Binding of Isaac, Subway Surfers, and 10 Minutes Until Dawn.</p>
      <p>Small website tweaks</p>
    </div>

    <div class="version-container" style="background-image: linear-gradient(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4), rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4)), url('/img/websiteutility/update/3.0.png');">
      <h2>3.0: the third one</h2>
      <p>New UI. New website format with a sidebar, like luma beta had. New games UI with animated iframe and pop out for certain games that require it.</p>
      <p>New images, game icons are in webp format now which is faster and more efficient.</p>
      <p>Redesigned pages, updates, contact me, etc.</p>
      <p>raw.githack is unblocked again which allows me to do a lot of cool stuff</p>
      <p>New games like Half-Life, Traffic Jam 3D, Tetr.io, etc.</p>
      <p>Every game should be fixed, this includes retro games, burrito bison, and yes, drift hunters (sort of).</p>
      <p>Retro section runs off of emulatorjs instead of webretro now as webretro is deprecated.</p>
      <p>Retro section has N64 games that were previously removed due to file size games like Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask are back.</p>
      <p>Cloud gaming support has been added so most games you have on your Xbox console and some games in your steam library are now playable in class.</p>
      <p>New sorting system for games, games are now sorted alphabetically and not in their own sections anymore.</p> 
      <p>Added ChatGPT and a calculator.</p>
      <p>New logo (it looks so good)</p>
      <p>New subtitles</p>
      <p>New secrets</p>
      <p>Thanks for waiting so long, enjoy.</p>

      <h2>2.8.1: retro patch</h2>
      <p>I fixed about 50% of the retro games. All of them should be fixed by 2.8.2.</p>
      <p>Had to remove Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask because of the 25MB file limit :(</p>
    </div>

    <div class="version-container" style="background-image: linear-gradient(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4), rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4)), url('/img/websiteutility/update/2.8.png');">
      <h2>2.8: tyshon update</h2>
      <p>I'm actually working on Luma again.</p>
      <p>
        Raw.githubusercontent.com was taken down, which is like the backbone of Luma, so I had to recode like every single game. 
        How I am sane is beyond me. Most games should work like they did before in 2.7 except for the retro section, which I haven't worked on yet.
      </p>
      <p>Added a few games, removed a couple because they were too big in file size...</p>
      <p>Thx for 20k :DDD</p>

    <div class="version-container" style="background-image: linear-gradient(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4), rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4)), url('/img/websiteutility/update/2.7.png');">
      <h2>2.7: merry valentines</h2>
      <p>
        Unlike the background suggests, I did actually fix a lot of the games. 
        91.62% work fine without issue. 8.38% of games still need to be fixed. 
        Luma is close to 100% of the games unblocked. Once again, refer to

        for the list of broken and working games on Luma.

      <p>New Valentine's Day theme.</p>

      <h2>2.6: just fix the frecking gams</h2>
      <p>
        First update of 2024, I'm fixing all the games. Refer to 
        <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JqJ5tFtczpXQJfCTLSmfhFFb4SyUPVxzEQHe1EZO0wI/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>

      </p>
      <p>"Most" platformer games work now.</p>
      <p>All Flash and Retro games fully work.</p>
      <p>
        The "Other" section of games is a hellhole of broken games. I haven't worked on it yet. 
        Should be fixed in v2.6.1.

      <h2>2.0: 75 Games</h2>
      <p>Original commit with new updates from 1.0.</p>
      <p>Unblocked the website (sorry it took like 3 weeks). I was almost finished with Luma 1.1, then I found Lioxyrt's code and decided to rework the entire website.</p>
      <p>Added settings, which allows you to change the look of your webpage.</p>
      <p>Launched with 75 gamesâ€”this is the most games any game website I've made has ever had.</p>
      <p>Working games with cleaner code! Expect new games to come faster.</p>
      <p>Added an "Extras" section. Not much is working yet, but since they're like 1-second experiences, I won't support them. I'll support the soundbar, though.</p>
      <p>Added an "About Me" section because a large majority of people didnâ€™t know who made it. I'd like to take some credit! :)</p>
