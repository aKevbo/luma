    <h1>Updates</h1>

    <div class="version-container" style="background-image: linear-gradient(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4), rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4)), url('/img/websiteutility/update/3.0.png');">
      <h2>3.0: the third one</h2>
      <p>New UI. New website format with a sidebar, like luma beta had. New games UI with animated iframe and pop out for certain games that require it.</p>
      <p>New images, game icons are in webp format now which is faster and more efficient.</p>
      <p>Redesigned pages, updates, contact me, etc.</p>
      <p>raw.githack is unblocked again which allows me to do a lot of cool stuff</p>
      <p>New games like Half-Life, Traffic Jam 3D, Tetr.io, etc.</p>
      <p>Every game should be fixed, this includes retro games, burrito bison, and yes, drift hunters (sort of).</p>
      <p>Retro section runs off of emulatorjs instead of webretro now as webretro is deprecated.</p>
      <p>Retro section has N64 games that were previously removed due to file size games like Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask are back.</p>
      <p>Cloud gaming support has been added so most games you have on your Xbox console and some games in your steam library are now playable in class.</p>
      <p>New sorting system for games, games are now sorted alphabetically and not in their own sections anymore.</p> 
      <p>Added ChatGPT and a calculator.</p>
      <p>New logo (it looks so good)</p>
      <p>New subtitles</p>
      <p>New secrets</p>
      <p>Thanks for waiting so long, enjoy.</p>

      <h2>2.8.1: retro patch</h2>
      <p>I fixed about 50% of the retro games. All of them should be fixed by 2.8.2.</p>
      <p>Had to remove Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask because of the 25MB file limit :(</p>

      <h2>2.8: tyshon update</h2>
      <p>I'm actually working on Luma again.</p>
      <p>
        Raw.githubusercontent.com was taken down, which is like the backbone of Luma, so I had to recode like every single game. 
        How I am sane is beyond me. Most games should work like they did before in 2.7 except for the retro section, which I haven't worked on yet.
      </p>
      <p>Added a few games, removed a couple because they were too big in file size...</p>
      <p>Thx for 20k :DDD</p>

      <h2>2.7: merry valentines</h2>
      <p>
        Unlike the background suggests, I did actually fix a lot of the games. 
        91.62% work fine without issue. 8.38% of games still need to be fixed. 
        Luma is close to 100% of the games unblocked. Once again, refer to

      <p>New Valentine's Day theme.</p>

      <h2>2.6: just fix the frecking gams</h2>
      <p>
        First update of 2024, I'm fixing all the games. Refer to 
        <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JqJ5tFtczpXQJfCTLSmfhFFb4SyUPVxzEQHe1EZO0wI/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>

      <p>"Most" platformer games work now.</p>
      <p>All Flash and Retro games fully work.</p>
      <p>
        The "Other" section of games is a hellhole of broken games. I haven't worked on it yet. 
        Should be fixed in v2.6.1.

      <p>Winter event over.</p>
      <p>Thx for 13k :)</p>

      <p>Added a bunch of new games to the "Other Games" section. Gave the website a new look.</p>
      <p>New menu bar: now curved and detached from the website, no longer blending in with sections.</p>

      <p>Moved "Dreader" to the "Other Games" section (RIP spooky event) :(</p>

      <p>Added "Basket Bros," "Smash Karts," and "Idle Breakout."</p>
      <p>Fixed "1v1.lol," "Snow Rider 3D," and "SwordBattle.io."</p>

      <h2>2.0: 75 Games</h2>
      <p>Original commit with new updates from 1.0.</p>
      <p>Unblocked the website (sorry it took like 3 weeks). I was almost finished with Luma 1.1, then I found Lioxyrt's code and decided to rework the entire website.</p>
      <p>Added settings, which allows you to change the look of your webpage.</p>
      <p>Launched with 75 games—this is the most games any game website I've made has ever had.</p>
      <p>Working games with cleaner code! Expect new games to come faster.</p>
      <p>Added an "Extras" section. Not much is working yet, but since they're like 1-second experiences, I won't support them. I'll support the soundbar, though.</p>
      <p>Added an "About Me" section because a large majority of people didn’t know who made it. I'd like to take some credit! :)</p>
